## Why Go Green?

Go Green was founded in 2020 by four friends during the Web Development course at Ironhack SÃ£o Paulo. 

The company was born from our interest in **reducing meat consumption** and **making the transition as easy as possible for our users** - chefs, cooks, and the curious! 

We offer a tool where people can **share their recipes** and also **contribute to third party recipes**, through evaluations or even proposing changes. 

We hope to encourage more people to opt for meatless food, thereby reducing the impacts on the environment :earth_americas:, personal health :muscle: and animal welfare :cow:.

## The App

Go Green consists in an information sharing platform and social network based on vegetarian and vegan recipes.

As a **public open-source application**, user do not need to sign in in order to see recipes details.

On the other hand, the fast sign up form allow user to contribute **adding new recipe** and editing it when needed.

#### Step-by-step

- Sign Up :iphone:
